For this project, I worked with classmates in CS7290 to develop a website displaying the results of a local air quality monitoring project. The site is built on top of an Observable notebook, a relatively new system cell-based system for writing JavaScript. The results include a series of visualizations and UI tools that interact with each other and with a MapLibre GL JS map. Check out the work below and at [https://cs7290.github.io/stinky](https://cs7290.github.io/stinky).
