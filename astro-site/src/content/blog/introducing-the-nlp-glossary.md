When I applied for my current role as a Data Scientist in the Clinical and Generative AI and NLP team at IDEXX, I knew that I was going to need to be as sharp as possible on NLP terms and techniques. To prepare for my technical interview, I wrote my own "Glossary" of NLP terms, complete with mathematical formulae and code snippets. My hope was that if someone asked me to code [`tf-idf`](/nlp-glossary#tf-idf) or explain [lemmatization](/nlp-glossary#lemmatization) in my technical interview, I'd be ready to impress.

I decided to share the glossary here as part of motivating myself to continue updating it. This exercise is partly inspired by my experience with Prof. Alan Jamieson's algorithms class from grad school, which required us to write mini-textbooks in our own words as an alternative to traditional exams.
